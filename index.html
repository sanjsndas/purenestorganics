                <div class="consultant-text">
                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>Founded in 2015 by horticulturist Emma Richardson, PureNest Organics began as a small urban gardening initiative in New York City. Frustrated by the lack of sustainable, space-efficient gardening solutions for urban dwellers, Emma developed innovative potted garden systems that could thrive in limited spaces while supporting local ecosystems. Our mission is to empower individuals and communities to embrace gardening, regardless of space constraints.</p>
                    <p>What started as a passion project quickly grew into a full-service organic gardening company serving residential and commercial clients throughout the tri-state area. Today, our team includes landscape architects, irrigation specialists, and organic gardening experts who share a common vision: to bring nature back into urban environments in ways that are beautiful, sustainable, and accessible. We are dedicated to educating our clients about the benefits of organic gardening and the importance of biodiversity in urban settings.</p>
                    <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>At PureNest Organics, we believe that even the smallest potted garden can make a big difference. Our approach combines traditional horticultural wisdom with modern ecological science to create gardens that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Support local biodiversity by incorporating native plants and pollinator-friendly species.</li>
                        <li>Improve air quality through the natural filtration provided by plants.</li>
                        <li>Provide habitat for pollinators, contributing to the health of local ecosystems.</li>
                        <li>Offer therapeutic benefits, enhancing mental well-being and reducing stress.</li>
                        <li>Enhance urban aesthetics, making cities more livable and enjoyable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We're committed to using only organic, sustainable materials and practices in all our services. From our peat-free potting mixes to our water-conserving irrigation systems, every aspect of our work reflects our dedication to environmental stewardship. We strive to inspire our clients to adopt sustainable practices in their own lives, fostering a deeper connection with nature.</p>

                <h3 class="tip-title">Choose the Right Plants</h3>
                <p>Select plants that are suited to your local climate and the specific conditions of your space, such as sunlight and moisture levels. Researching native plants can also help you create a garden that thrives with minimal intervention.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-card">
                <h3 class="tip-title">Water Wisely</h3>
                <p>Use a moisture meter to determine when your plants need water, and consider installing a drip irrigation system for efficiency. This not only conserves water but also ensures your plants receive consistent moisture.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-card">
                <h3 class="tip-title">Fertilize Organically</h3>
